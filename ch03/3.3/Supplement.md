### 3.3.8
Proof:
For regexs with complemented character class, we replace all complemented character class with a character class with no ^.
Now prove that such replacement is always feasible.

Let class A denotes the original complemented character class we want to replace.
For all characters in Î£, if it does not appear in A, add it to character class B.
Then, we prove class A is equivalent to class B.
Any character can be matched to A iff it does not appear in A.
Any character can be matched to B iff it appears in B.
Every character appears in B iff it does not appear in A.
Q.E.D.

### 3.3.11
We define a function f
If c is not a special character in Regex, f(c)=c
Otherwise, f(c)=\c
Define C shorthand of a|b|c|d|..|A|B|C|...|0|1|2|...|,|\.|\*|...
(Which means, we replace C by a|b|c|d|..|A|B|C|...|0|1|2|...|,|\.|\*|... )

's':
Write s as cS' (concatenation)
's' can be recursively translated as f(c)f(S')  (concatenation)

'\c' can be translated as f(c)

* can be translated as C*

? can be translated as C

[s]:
Write s as cS' (concatenation)
[s] can be recursively translated as f(c)|f(S')

### 3.3.12

_ can be translated as .
% can be translated as .*
Suppose e is a escape character.
e_ e% and ee can be translated as e.
e can be writen as what it means in SQL. Then we translated the sequence from SQL into Regex.
